#  * Definition for a binary tree node.
#  * function TreeNode(val, left, right) {
#  *     this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val)
#  *     this.left = (left===undefined ? null : left)
#  *     this.right = (right===undefined ? null : right)
#  * }
#  * @param {TreeNode} root
#  * @return {number}
#  * 
#  * Given the root of a binary tree, return the length of the diameter of the tree.
#  * 
#  * The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.
#  * 
#  * The length of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.
